## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project was 2 months away from my last FrontEnd Mentor challenge project. Honestly I didn't learned anything new but I was able to finally upload a project using JS after 2 months of studying.

### Continued development

I would like to more efficiently write JS code.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/) - This is one of the courses I've been following on JS and it was really helpful. I got the loading screen idea from here.

Once again to my cats for making me company during this learning process and path and my girlfriend who is currently waiting for me to finish the project so we can play videogames.
